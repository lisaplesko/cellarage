Project Description
-------
This project was created to meet requirements for Project 1 in General Assembly's Web Development Immersive Program (May 2014).

Intended to test our ability to create a functional Rails app, this project required three related models and use of at least one API source.  I am currently using four models and one API source (wine.com).

This project was brainstormed, scoped and developed in one week.  If given more time, I have a list of additional features to add to the project; I would also like to refactor to make the code more DRY.

    User stories & future feature ideas are located in ProjectPlan.md


Installation
-------

This app requires an API key from wine.com at https://api.wine.com/

To begin, run `bundle install`

If you would like to begin with an initial user and sample data, run `rake db:seed`
