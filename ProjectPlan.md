Project idea: Wine cellar inventory tracking

USER STORIES:

DONE * User can add wines to a personal inventory

DONE * User can view all wines in personal inventory

DONE * User can store inventory of wines unopened, as well as wines consumed

DONE * User can review a wine

DONE * User can update quantity of wine as they drink wine/buy wine

* [API use] User can enter UPC/product ID of wine and the remaining details of wine will be retrieved
---> After research, most API's currently do not support lookup by UPC or product ID, which is unfortunate.

DONE * [API use] User can receive a list of recommendations of similar wines based on a current on in their list

DONE * Main page will show total bottles of wine stored in cellar across ALL users

DONE * Main page will also give total count of wines consumed
DONE * User can sort wines by category, occasion, and grape/varietal



Nice to have features, if time permits:
* User can choose from the 'recommendations' and add to a saved list of wines to check out/buy later
* User can view a map of all locations with the regions that their current inventory is from
* User can receive a list of wines to be consumed NOW based on their recommended drinking age date [Can API do this?]
* User can share a wine/description/review on Twitter or Facebook to a friend


USER EXPERIENCE:

Login page:  Shows overall details of cellar across all members

User login:  Landing page is current inventory with two tables (wines in stock, and wines consumed)  **Ideally put wines consumed on a separate page?

User can click link and land on page which shows all regions where wines are from

User click on wine:  See full specs of wine, maybe grab additional data from API?  User should be able to click link and land on new page with recommendations to similar wines

User can update quantities on this page - an "add" button should contribute to total of instock wine, while a "drink" button should subtract from instock and add to consumed quantities.

Design should be mobile-first. Wines will probably be shown in a table, but only if a responsive table can be put together?

WIREFRAMES - stored in Moleskine notebook.
