    name "Eroica"
    vineyard "Chateau Ste. Michelle"
    description "Eroica is an elegant off-dry Washington Riesling that has blazed a trail for high-end American Riesling."
    # Eroica delivers a unique combination of mandarin orange aromas characteristic of Washington state Rieslings, melded with the mineral, spiced apple and slate notes with lively, crisp acidity associated with German Riesling. The wineâ€™s zesty acidity, combined with a touch of sweetness, makes it a tremendously versatile and food friendly wine.
